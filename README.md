# MouseShaker
Little program that keeps your mouse moving.

##### Background:
I used to work this crapy company that took advantage of all thier IT staff. Some days when I'd 
had enough I would call in and say I was working from home. My ninty year old superviser would monitor 
our online status like a Nazi (yes you Danny). We couldn't turn off or hack the group policy that put your 
computer to sleep and show you were "away", so I would crank up this little guy and go back to sleep.
